Summary of Practice Case Study: Trusts and Small Business CGT Concessions

Background:
- Arthur Jones: Former farmer who transferred farming activities to his son William due to an accident.
- William Family Trust: Established on 30 June 2019 for William’s family. William Nominees Pty Ltd is the trustee with Mr. Obedient as the appointor. William is the "test individual" for family trust election purposes.

1. Lease Agreement: Arthur leased farming property to the William Family Trust with veto rights.

2024 Transactions:

2. Sale of Equipment and Livestock: Trust sold equipment for $100000 (written down value $10) and livestock for $250000 (cost base $10000).

Advice Required:
1. Arthur Jones:
   - CGT Implications: Determine eligibility for CGT concessions to reduce capital gain from the sale of his farm property.

2. William Family Trust:
   - CGT Concessions:
     - Assess if the trust can reduce gains from asset sales using small business CGT concessions.
     - Identify applicable CGT concessions and outline actions needed to maximize them.

Professional Conduct Concerns:
- Use of Information: Confirm if Arthur Jones’s or his advisor’s confirmation is needed for using financial information.
- Prior Income Reporting Issues: Address concerns about unreported business income in previous years.

Trust Deed Clauses:
- Trust Establishment: Specific attributes include appointor and trustee’s powers.
- Income and Capital Distribution: Trustee can classify and distribute income and capital including dealing with losses.

Late Breaking Facts:
1. Grace’s Potential Property Sale:
   - Grace is considering selling her property used in the William Family Trust’s farming activities and wants to know about using Division 152 concessions to reduce her capital gain.

2. Arthur Jones’s Nursery Land:
   - Arthur seeks advice on the tax implications of selling his nursery land used for growing flowers with an estimated value of $1 million and cost base of $250000. He has not claimed deductions for this property.

3. Mr. Obedient’s Influence:
   - Mr. Obedient though the appointor of the William Family Trust follows Arthur’s directions which may affect the Trust's transactions and decisions.

4. Trust Income Distribution for 2024:
   - The trust might not have income due to substantial asset write-offs raising questions about the impact on Division 152 concessions.

Suggested Solutions:

1. For Grace:
   - Eligibility for Division 152 Concessions: Advise on meeting basic conditions and active asset test. Recommend considering the timing of the sale to potentially improve eligibility.

2. For Arthur Jones:
   - PPR Exemption: Confirm if the property qualifies for the Principal Place of Residence (PPR) exemption.
   - Business Status: Determine if Arthur’s flower growing qualifies as a business and if the nursery land is an active asset.
   - Alternative Strategies: Explore options like selling for less reclassifying the business or transferring shares to a super fund.

3. For Mr. Obedient:
   - Influence on Trust: Review the impact of Mr. Obedient’s influence on CGT concessions and Trust decisions and assess any implications for the Trust’s tax matters.

4. For the Trust:
   - No Income Distribution: Clarify the impact of no income distribution on accessing Division 152 concessions and confirm that prior year distributions can still support eligibility for CGT concessions.
